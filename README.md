# NewsAPI

## Overview

 This is a very simple API that allows a user to create news posts and persist them in a database. The post will simply have a title and body. To interact with the API, I use the REST Client extension for VS Code.

## Installing

 Once cloned into a local repository, open a terminal in the root folder and run ```npm install``` to install the appropriate packages. Also, you must have **MongoDB** installed locally.

## Testing

You can begin working with the API by running ```npm run DevStart``` in the terminal. The file ```posts.rest``` in the root folder contains requests that can be used to interact with the API once it is running.
