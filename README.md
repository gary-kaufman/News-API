# News-API :newspaper:

## Overview

This is a very simple API that allows a user to create news posts and persist them in a local database. The post will simply have a title, body, and date. To interact with the API, I use the REST Client extension for VS Code. This project is based off of the many YouTube videos that create a simple REST API with Express and Mongoose.

## Installing

Once cloned into a local repository, open a terminal in the root folder and run ```npm install``` to install the appropriate packages. Also, you must have **MongoDB** installed locally.

## Testing

You can begin working with the API by running ```npm run devStart``` in the terminal. The file ```posts.rest``` in the root folder contains requests that can be used to interact with the API once it is running.
